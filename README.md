# mundanish

A wiki to be filled with the world and systems for a roll20 campaign of the same name.

GOALS OF THE PROJECT:
- Create a world both utterly silly and compellingly real
- Create a system of tabletop play that feels whimsical
- Create a system of tabletop play that allows for emergent gameplay in spades while maintaining a sense of balance

Github has excellent wiki-stuffs, doesn't it?
